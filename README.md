```
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my
여기저기 joke 웃어 online
예상을 깨버려 미안 I'm a surprise
눈뜨면 쏟아지는 Shorts 무한 감사
계속 로딩 중이야 예측 불가
Me and my girls 붙여진 이름
마치 나보다 날 더 잘 아는 것 같음
온몸에 labelling labelling
안 보일 지경이야
이거 좀 떼어내고 싶어
What the ***
Ah oops! 카멜레온
10000 피스 퍼즐처럼
oops! Like a 논문
답정너가 아닌걸
난 그냥 나일뿐
될 수 있어 뭐든지 마음대로
They call me LIT
They call me IL-LIT
They call me 냥
They call me 뽀용
They call me 애
They call me jelly
They call me J
They call me 댕
They call me LIT
They call me IL-LIT
They call me E
They call me Bad
They call me 햄
They call me Princess
They call me BAE
They call me Core
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my
전부 틀린 건 아냐
때론 맞기도 하지
그냥 날 가두어두지는 마
그 맛이 짜릿해
Ah oops! Look what I've done
레벨 무한 난이도 what 그게 나인 걸
Because we're more than what they see
과감히 지워버려 테두리
Born to be ( )
Be what we want
They call me LIT
They call me IL-LIT
They call me Real
They call me 꿈
They call me Lead
They call me 언니
They call me 킹
They call me Star
They call me LIT
They call me IL-LIT
They call me 콩
They call me Luck
They call me Nerd
They call me 여신
They call me Duck
They call me Love
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
That's not my name
That's not my, not my, not my name
