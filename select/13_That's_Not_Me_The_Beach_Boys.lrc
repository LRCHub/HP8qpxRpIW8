[00:00.24] I had to prove that I could make it alone
[00:04.21] But that's not me
[00:09.06] I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now
[00:13.21] But that's not me
[00:21.71] 
[00:17.08] I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
[00:21.23] What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl
[00:48.23] 
[00:33.78] I'm a little bit scared
[00:35.51] 'Cause I haven't been home in a long time
[00:42.04] You needed my love
[00:43.52] And I know that I left at the wrong time
[00:52.51] My folks when I wrote them
[00:54.16] Told 'em what I was up, to said that's not me
[01:16.66] 
[00:59.96] I went through all kinds of changes
[01:02.75] Took a look at myself and said that's not me
[01:08.72] I miss my pad and the places I've known
[01:13.27] And every night as I lay there alone, I will dream
[01:38.27] 
[01:25.82] I once had a dream
[01:27.49] So I packed up and split for the city
[01:34.03] I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
[01:41.92] I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready
[02:11.92] 
[01:52.37] I once had a dream
[01:54.69] So I packed up and split for the city
[02:00.60] I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
[02:08.81] I once had a dream
[02:10.62] So I packed up and split for the city
[02:16.92] I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
